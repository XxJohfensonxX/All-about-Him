Jesus Christ 

Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the 
central figure of Christianity. He was born
 over 2,000 years ago in Bethlehem to
 Mary, a virgin, through the power of the 
Holy Spirit. He grew up in Nazareth and 
began His ministry around the age of 30. 

Jesus taught people about God's love,
 forgiveness, humility, and the coming of 
the Kingdom of Heaven. He used 
parables (short stories with moral 
lessons) to teach people how to live
 good, faithful lives. He also performed
 many miracles, such as healing the sick, 
calming storms, and feeding thousands
of people.

Many people followed Jesus, but others, 
especially some religious leaders, were
 against Him. He was arrested, put on
 trial, and crucified-nailed to a cross-to
 die. Christians believe that His death 
 was a sacrifice to save all people from sin. 

Three days after His death, Jesus rose 
from the dead-an event called the 
Resurrection. He appeared to His
 followers and then ascended to heaven, 
promising to return one day. 

Jesus is worshiped as the Savior,
 Messiah, and Lord by Christians. His life 
and message have influenced billions of
 people and shaped the history and values 
of the world
